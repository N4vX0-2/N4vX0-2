# Hi, I'm James (N4vx0-2) 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! My username is a tribute to my late father, based off his ham radio call sign, inspired my earliest work with hardware and electronics around the age of six. This page is a portfolio of my journey from childhood soldering sessions to modern security and automation projects.

## 📻 Why N4vx0-2?
My first exposure to electronics and security was tinkering with ham radios alongside my father. Every project here is in some way built on the skills and curiosity he inspired. We all stand on the sholders of flawed but great people.
